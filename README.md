# What is this?

This is the repository for my Vim configuration.  My background is in software development, so much of this is tuned for a developer's workflow, however I've since expanded my use of Vim to cover writing and note taking, as well.  As a result, this also includes my vimwiki configuration plus writing-related plugins like Goyo.  If you want to see the list of plugins, take a look at the contained .gitlayer file.

As vim and tmux are the ying to the other's yang, I've also included my tmux configuration as part of this repo.

Note, while I used to spend a lot of time running Vim on Windows, those days are largely gone, so this has only been tested on Linux.

# How to use this repository

1. Run `install.rb`

That's it.
